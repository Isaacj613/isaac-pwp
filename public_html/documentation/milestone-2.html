<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
<p> The purpose I have for this website is quite simple i want this website to demonstrate the skills I am acquiring during this bootcamp and display them. Here are some of the features i plan to have on this website.</p>

<h3>Nav Bar</h3>
<p>In the nav bar for mobile I plan to have a drop down menu on the top right of the webpage where it will display 3 options once selected.</p>
<ul>
    <li>My Bio</li>
    <li>Projects</li>
    <li>My links</li>
</ul>
<p>These options will also be available in a computer web page but will be stretched along the nav bar and not a drop down</p>

<p>once a option is selected it will navigate you to the part of the page that the option is in.</p>

<h3>My Bio</h3>
<p>Just a brief description of me</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<p> also what will be displayed are cards with an image of a project and a brief description the card is clickable to take to github </p>

<h3>Links</h3>
<p> provided will be links to my email social media and git hub</p>
